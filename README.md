# Description
Project made as a testbed for experimenting with javascript. This has since
expanded to also exploring docker containers, mysql, and Node.js.

The original implementation was purely in JavaScript, but is being moved over to working in Node.js.
As of right now, it's WIP and should be considered non-functional, as it's still using
just the old javascript.
